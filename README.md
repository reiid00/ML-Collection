# ML-Collection

Welcome to the `ml-collection` repository! This repository is a showcase of my personal work in Machine Learning, which I have developed in my free time. I have created this repository to demonstrate my skills and passion for the field. It contains a collection of ML projects and papers that I have implemented.

## Overview

The `ml-collection` repository is organized into two main folders:

1. `Projects` - This folder contains the projects I have worked on. Each project is stored in its own subfolder and includes a detailed README, source code, and relevant resources.

2. `Papers` - This folder contains implementations of various ML research papers. Each paper implementation is stored in its own subfolder and includes a detailed README, source code, and relevant resources.

## Collection

### Projects

In the `Projects` folder, you will find a variety of projects I have worked on. These projects span various domains and utilize a range of ML techniques. Each project subfolder includes a README file that provides an overview of the project, the problem it addresses, the methodology employed, and the results obtained.

### Papers

In the `Papers` folder, you will find implementations of several ML research papers. Each paper implementation subfolder includes a README file that provides a brief overview of the paper, the techniques used, and the results obtained. The README also includes a link to the original paper for reference.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `ml-collection` repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```console
git clone https://github.com/reiid00/ML-Collection.git
```

Navigate to the desired project or paper implementation folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file.
