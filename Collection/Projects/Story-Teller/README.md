# Story Telling AI Overview

## Overview

The Story Telling AI is a small deep learning project that generates simple stories based on user input. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create a sequence of images with text describing the story. The user can interact with the system throughout the story development to personalize its output.

## 1. Requirements

- Generate simple stories based on user input
- Allow user interaction throughout the development of the story
- Output a sequence of images with text describing the story
- Support multiple characters and events
- Leverage NLP and GANs

## 2. System Architecture

The system will consist of three main components:

1. NLP model for generating story text
2. GAN model for generating story images
3. User interface for user input and interaction

### 2.1. NLP Model

- Model: GPT-like model (e.g., GPT-3)
- Input: user prompt and previous story context
- Output: story text for the current part of the story

### 2.2. GAN Model

- Model: StyleGAN-like model (e.g., StyleGAN2)
- Input: story text and scene description
- Output: generated image representing the scene

### 2.3. User Interface

- Web-based interface
- Input fields for user prompts and interaction
- Display area for generated story text and images
- Buttons to progress and customize the story

## 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. Collect story datasets (e.g., Project Gutenberg, ASOIF)
2. Preprocess data:
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization
   - Removal of special characters and punctuation
3. Create scene description datasets (text-image pairs)

## 4. NLP Model

1. Fine-tune GPT-like model with collected story datasets
2. Implement story generation function:
   - Accepts user input and story context
   - Generates story text for the current part
   - Returns generated text and updated context

## 5. GAN Model

1. Train StyleGAN-like model with collected scene description datasets
2. Implement image generation function:
   - Accepts story text and scene description
   - Generates image representing the scene
   - Returns generated image

## 6. User Interface

1. Design web interface
2. Implement user input and interaction functionality
3. Display generated story text and images
4. Integrate NLP and GAN model functions
5. Implement story progression and customization options

## 7. Integration and Testing

1. Integrate NLP and GAN models with the user interface
2. Test system with various inputs and user interactions
3. Optimize system performance and user experience
4. Deploy the system
