# TrainingArguments Explanation

This document explains the hyperparameters used in the `TrainingArguments` configuration for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model.

## Hyperparameters

- `output_dir`: The directory for storing output files, including the model checkpoints.
- `overwrite_output_dir`: Whether to overwrite the output directory if it already exists.
- `num_train_epochs`: The number of training epochs.
- `per_device_train_batch_size`: Number of training samples per batch per device (e.g., GPU).
- `per_device_eval_batch_size`: Number of evaluation samples per batch per device (e.g., GPU).
- `evaluation_strategy`: The evaluation strategy during training. Set it to `"epoch"` to evaluate at the end of each epoch.
- `logging_dir`: Directory for storing logs.
- `logging_strategy`: When to log. Set it to `"steps"` to log every `logging_steps` steps.
- `logging_steps`: The number of steps between logging.
- `save_steps`: The number of steps between model checkpoint saves.
- `save_total_limit`: The maximum number of model checkpoints to keep.
- `load_best_model_at_end`: Whether to load the best model found at the end of training.
- `metric_for_best_model`: The metric used to determine the best model.
- `greater_is_better`: Whether a greater metric value is better for determining the best model.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: Number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing an optimization step.
- `fp16`: Whether to use 16-bit (mixed) precision training.
- `fp16_backend`: The backend for mixed precision training. Set it to `"auto"` to use the best available backend.
- `fp16_full_eval`: Whether to use full 16-bit precision evaluation.
- `learning_rate`: The initial learning rate for the optimizer.
- `weight_decay`: The weight decay rate for the optimizer.
- `adam_beta1`: The first beta parameter for the Adam optimizer.
- `adam_beta2`: The second beta parameter for the Adam optimizer.
- `adam_epsilon`: The epsilon value for the Adam optimizer to prevent division by zero.
- `max_grad_norm`: The maximum gradient norm for gradient clipping. Set it to a positive value to enable gradient clipping.
- `lr_scheduler_type`: The learning rate scheduler type. Set it to `"linear"` for linear learning rate decay.
- `warmup_steps`: The number of warmup steps for the learning rate scheduler. The learning rate will increase linearly from 0 to the initial learning rate during the warmup steps.
- `label_smoothing_factor`: The label smoothing factor for the loss function. Set it to a value between 0 and 1 to enable label smoothing. A value of 0 means no label smoothing.
- `report_to`: A list of integrations to report training logs and metrics. In this example, we report to TensorBoard.
- `seed`: The random seed for reproducible training.
